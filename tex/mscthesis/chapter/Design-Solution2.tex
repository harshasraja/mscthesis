\section{Solution2:  Metadata as a Top Row} \label{s:design-sol2}


In this solution,   metadata is embedded with the actual data and exists in the
same column family as the actual data which is similar to Solution~1. 
% where metadata is stored within the same column family. 
However,  in this solution   metadata is saved only once in the column family as
a top row or the first super column in a column family with the unique
\texttt{RowId} '\texttt{-1}'.  This top row has only the \texttt{Metadata} 
column containing the metadata information as its value while the rest of the
super columns in the same column family have different columns containing the
actual data.  This design is possible since Cassandra allows rows to have
different number of columns,  as described in
Section~\ref{s::key-value-data-model}.  The \texttt{Metadata} column is similar
to the Solution~1 as shown in Figure~\ref{fd:Metadata-Solution1} (a).  Thus,  for
each column family,  its metadata exists only once as a single row and is common
for all its super columns.  In the University example,   \texttt{Student} column
family has the metadata  stored as a top row as  shown in
Figure~\ref{fd:Metadata-Solution2}.  This approach helps preserve the dependency
information while also making it easily accessible for the referential integrity 
validations.

Similar to Solution~1,   metadata in this solution contains special characters
'\texttt{\{}',  '\texttt{\}}', '\texttt{;}' and '\texttt{:}' to distinguish all
the constraints and its different parts and values.  Metadata  for each
column family contains it \ac{PK} constraints and its associated \ac{FK}
constraints.  This is again as modelled in Solution~1.  Thus,  in this Solution too
the metadata for \texttt{Student} will contain its \ac{PK} constraint
\texttt{CONST100} and \ac{FK} constraint \texttt{CONST700} as its metadata in
the top row (Figure~\ref{fd:Metadata-Solution2}). Thus,  this solution differs
from Solution~1 only in the way the metadata is stored to improve resource
utilisation and the way special characters are used and saving only the
relevant constraints for a column family are  the same as in Solution~1. 
% 	\begin{itemize}
% 	  \item   constraint showing the primary key of the column family. 
% 	  \item \ac{FK} constraints 
% 			\begin{itemize}
% 				\item In the case of a parent entity the \ac{FK} constraints are the \ac{FK}
% 				constraints of type '\texttt{F}' to identify the child entities when the entity
% 				is being updated or deleted. 
% 				\item  In the case of a child entity the \ac{FK} constraint of type '\texttt{R}'
% 				would be stored along with the \ac{PK} constraint which indicates its parent
% 				entities. 
% 				\item If an entity is both a parent and child entity,  then its metadata would
% 				hold its \ac{PK} constraint,  and the \ac{FK} constraints of both types. 
% 			\end{itemize}
% 	\end{itemize}
	
% Consider \texttt{Enrolment}  which is a child entity with parent entities
% \texttt{Student} and \texttt{Course} (Figure~\ref{}).  Its metadata thus contains
% its \ac{PK} constraint \texttt{CONST300} and the \ac{FK} constraints
% \texttt{CONST400} and \texttt{CONST500}.  Since \texttt{Student} is a child
% entity it  stores its \ac{PK} constraint \texttt{CONST100} and its \ac{FK}
% constraint \texttt{CONST700}.  Similarly,  \texttt{Course} stores its \ac{PK} and
% respective \ac{FK} constraints. 
% 
% 	\begin{figure}
% 	\todo{ Insert metadata top row figure for Enrolment}
% 	\end{figure}
% 	Thus,  the metadats describes which is the
% 	primary key for the entity and the \ac{FK} constraints show which child entities dependent on the
% 	entity.  The \ac{FK} constraints are particularly useful to . 
	
The motivation behind this solution is to overcome the redundancy of metadata
storage in Solution~1.  In Solution~1,  metadata is stored in every super column
of a column family and replicated across the cluster along with the column
family.  Solution~2 reduces this redundancy and centralises the metadata as a top
row within the column family.  Thus,  when metadata is large lesser space is
consumed since it is not replicated as widely as in Solution~1. In other words, 
the aim of this design was to reduce the redundancy of metadata in the column
family whilst having metadata accessible to all the nodes by having it embedded
with the actual data. 
Furthermore,  this solution  ensures that when changes are made to the metadata
the actual data is not accessed and only the
column family  is accessed to fetch the top row containing the metadata.
