\section{Experimental API}\label{s:implementation-API}

The experimental \ac{API} was designed generically in order to ensure that it
can be used by  applications to maintain dependencies within their keyspaces
irrespective of keyspace schemas or structures of column families.  However,
applications using this \ac{API} still have to supply  the list of referential
integrity constraints as these are not automatically deduced from their
implementation. Instead, the constraints have to be introduced according to the
solution as it is explained in detail in
Section~\ref{s:implementation-MDinSolutions}.

% Thus,   this \ac{API} is made adaptable to different keyspace schemas  that
% can be deployed in column-oriented key-value \acp{DBMS}.

This \ac{API} validates the referential integrity based on the metadata provided
for the application and its column families.   It  provides the implementation of
all the four solutions as well as the required components to successfully
maintain referential integrity in Cassandra.

The  class diagram of the \ac{API} is presented  in
 Figure~\ref{f:classDiagram} alongside with the  classes that belong to 
the University keyspace example.  The design of the \ac{API} follows the
\ac{ER} model and the main components are the entities, entity managers,  and
validation handlers,  all of which are described in the next sections.
 Notice that for the sake of clarity and brevity,   the class diagram only
 contains  the relevant  methods of the classes,  favoring a simpler
explanation of the functioning of the \ac{API}.

	\subsection{Entities} 
	
	An \texttt{Entity} class contains attributes (with respective getters and
	setters) that map to columns within a specific column family.  As such,  the contents of a
	column family can be represented by a list of entity objects.  All entities in
	the \ac{API} extend from the class \texttt{Entity}  to
	aid the \ac{API} towards their management.  Particularly,  the attributes
	that \texttt{Entity} contains  are \texttt{columnFamily} which
	determines the column family to which the entity maps,  and 
	\texttt{keyForUpdate} which shall contain the new value in case the primary key
	of the entity is to be updated. 
	
	For example,   considering the University keyspace example,  \texttt{Enrolment} 
	is an entity class that  maps to the \texttt{Enrolment}  column family,  thus
	containing the attributes \texttt{RowId},  \texttt{CourseId} and
	\texttt{StudentId} which represent its respective columns.  As such,  an
	instance of \texttt{Enrolment} contains the values of one super column.  Likewise, 
	\texttt{Student} and \texttt{Course} are entity classes and their instances 
	map to   super columns in their respective column families. 
% 	For all the solutions in this \ac{API},   entities of the user applications are
% 	designed to extend the abstract class called \texttt{Entity},   which has
% 	information about the  methods for accessing and defining  entities.   For
% 	every column family,  applications derive a class from the
% 	\texttt{Entity} containing attributes. 
	Thus, the \ac{CRUD} operations that are performed on these entities  and are
	handled by the \texttt{EntityManager} class, explained next. 
		 
	\subsection{EntityManager} \label{ss:Implementation-API-EntityManager}

	The  \texttt{EntityManager} class implements  all
	the \ac{CRUD} operations to be performed on the entities.  In order to perform
	these operations,   the \texttt{EntityManager} interacts with the respective
	keyspace the entity belongs.  Moreover,  it ensures to trigger the   referential
	integrity validation process whenever a \ac{CRUD} operation requires it. The
	validation is triggered by invoking the respective methods on the  
	\texttt{ValidationHandler} object which is contained within the
	\texttt{EntityManager}.
	
	The \texttt{EntityManager},  before performing any operation,  requires a
	connection to the keyspace.  This connection is established using a third-party
	\ac{API} named Hector~\citep{hector}.  Hector  encapsulates the driver-level
	interface provided by Cassandra (known as Thrift) and simplifies the interaction
	with it.  Regarding the \ac{CRUD} operations,  Hector provides  a
	\texttt{Mutator} class that  encapsulates the necessary procedures to
	create, update, and delete \todo{a record}, and different classes to query
	for data (e.g. \texttt{SliceQuery}).
	 
	 Notice that  the \texttt{EntityManager} is able to generically deal with any
	 entity that derives from the \texttt{Entity} class. This can be seen in the
	 class diagram where \texttt{T} is a generic type which extends \texttt{Entity} 
	 and is used across the \ac{CRUD} methods. The \texttt{EntityManager} is able
	 to deal with any entity by using reflection, a Java
	 feature that performs  an introspection of a class to retrieve its
	 attributes, methods, annotations, among others. Moreover, the
	 methods retrieved from such a class can be invoked on an object in runtime. 
	 Thus, the \texttt{EntityManager} uses reflection to invoke the respective 
	 getter and setter methods of an entity in order to load it with data
	 from the column family or to write the data into a column family.
	 
	 
	
% 	Hector is a high
% 	 level client that wraps the driver-level interface of Cassandra called Thrift. 
% 	 Hector  provides some features that  Thrift does not,  for example,  
% 	 fail-over mechanisms and connection pooling (\todo{cite book}).   
	 % 	 While there
% 	 are other wrappers for Thrift,  Hector was  chosen as  it is one of the
% 	 earliest wrappers and  encapsulates the interaction with the Thrift \ac{API}
% 	 and makes it simpler to access a Cassandra cluster. 	
	
	
	
	
		\subsubsection{Create}
		The \texttt{create} (or \texttt{insert}) operation stores an entity in its
		respective column family. This operation triggers a referential integrity
		 validation whenever an  entity is  inserted.  Such validation is performed by
		 the \texttt{onInsert} method of \texttt{ValidationHandler}. Finally, if the
 		 \texttt{ValidationHandler} allows it,  the \texttt{EntityManager} passes the
		  entity details  including row key and column family as parameters to the
		 \texttt{addInsertion} method of the Hector \texttt{Mutator} object to perform
		 the insertion. This operation is detailed in Algorithm~\ref{a:em:insert}
		 
		 
% 		For example, all the student entities are inserted into the column family
% 		\texttt{Student} through the \texttt{EntityManager}.  
		
		 \begin{algorithm}
		 	\caption{Insert algorithm in \texttt{EntityManager}}\label{a:em:insert}

					\ForEach{attribute}{
						invoke \addInsertion on \Mutator passing attribute;\\
					}
					invoke \execute on \Mutator;\\
				}			
			}
			
		 \end{algorithm}
			
		\subsubsection{Read}
		The  \texttt{read} operation retrieves  entities from the column family mapped
		by the entity class.		
		This \ac{API} provides three methods for retrieving entities: \texttt{find},
		\texttt{query} and \texttt{read}. The \texttt{find} method retrieves a single
		entity given the class and the value of its primary key. The \texttt{query}
		method retrieves a list of entities from a column family given the class and a
		conditional expression $\left(< \;,\; \leq\;,\;=\;,\;\geq\;,\; > \right)$ on a
		column name and and its column value. The \texttt{read}  method retrieves
		 the list of entities contained in the column family. These methods are
		 detailed in Algorithms~\ref{a:em:find}, \ref{a:em:query} and~\ref{a:em:read},
		 respectively.  
		 
		 Notice that, these   operations do not prompt any referential
		  integrity validation since entities are only read and their state is not
		 changed,  unlike in the other operations.
		  
		  \begin{algorithm}[H]

		  		create \texttt{SliceQuery} of \clazz where PK = value;\\
		  		\If{no result was found}{

		  		}\Else{
		  			create instance of \clazz;\\
		  			load instance with result;\\

		  			add instance to list;\\ 
		  		}
		  		\Return{list} 
		  	}
		  \end{algorithm}

		
		
		\subsubsection{Update}\label{ss:update}
		
		The \texttt{update} operation changes the columns of an existing entity. If
		the changes to be performed are on columns which are not the primary key, then
		an \texttt{insert} operation is performed as it uses the primary key value of
		the entity to locate and replace the column values. Otherwise, if the
		primary key value is to be updated, then more actions need to be performed.
		Firstly, the entity with new primary key value has to be inserted, then all
		the children entities have to be located and their foreign keys updated to
		reflect the new primary key value, and finally the old entity has to be
		removed. 
		
		This operation triggers referential integrity constraints which are
		validated by the method \texttt{onUpdate} of the \texttt{ValidationHandler}
		when the primary key value is to be updated, otherwise, the respective
		validations are performed when the entity is inserted.

				\KwInsert entity with \keyForUpdate as primary key;\\
				
				invoke \onUpdate on \validationHandler passing entity \e ;\\
				
				\If{no exception is thrown}{
					invoke \delete from this \texttt{EntityManager} passing \e;\\
				}\Else{
					\delete entity with \keyForUpdate as primary key;\\
				}
				
					
			}
		\end{algorithm}
% 		
% 		
% 		
% 		\subsubsection{Update}\label{ss:update}
% 		The \texttt{update} operation perform changes to an existing \todo{record}
% 		 an entity and with new .
% 		  
% 		
% 		 to the contents of
% 		an entity with new contents and .   In other words,  the  values of the columns an entity
% 		represents are updated to new values and committed into the column families.
% 		
% 		The \texttt{EntityManager} provides the following three types of updates. 
% 		
% 		
% 		\begin{description}
% 			\item [Case A: Update Primary Key]  where the attribute
% 			\texttt{keyForUpdate} is used to indicate the change in the primary key.
% 			Before the primary key is updated, and there are child dependencies referencing
% 			the primary key,  the following steps are performed to complete the
% 			\texttt{update} operation.
% 		% In order to do so,  the \texttt{EntityManager} passes the entity to the
% 		% \texttt{ValidationHandler}  to check for referential integrity,  retrieves the
% 		% list of child entities that depend on its primary key,  deletes dependencies
% 		% and the entity,   and update the dependencies Following this,  the steps that
% 		% are performed are :
% \todo{FIX}
% % 			\begin{enumerate}
% % 			  
% % 			  
% % 			\item Check with the \texttt{ValidationHandler} if the entity can be updated.
% % 		
% % 			
% % 			\item Set the primary key of the entity to the \texttt{keyForUpdate} value. 
% % 			
% % 			\item Perform an \texttt{insert} of the entity with the new primary key.
% % 			
% % 			\item Retrieve the list of any child entities that depend on the old primary key
% % 			of the entity.
% % 
% % 			\item Update the foreign keys of the list of child entities to match the value
% % 			of the new primary key of the entity.
% % 			
% % 			\item Perform a \texttt{delete} operation on the old entity.
% % 		\item
% % 
% % 			\end{enumerate}
% % 		
% 		
% 	
% % 		In all the solutions,   an \texttt{Update} operation triggers a referential
% % 		 integrity validation whenever any primary or foreign keys of any entities are
% % 		updated. 
% % 		The validations are performed by the \texttt{onUpdate} method of the
% % 		\texttt{ValidationHandler}. 
% 			If the update is not a cascaded one, the child entities are not updated to
% 			the new primary keys. This is explained in Section~\ref{} Notice that such a
% 			procedure is used to circumvent the restriction of Cassandra to change a primary key.  Once a record has been
% 			inserted into the column family,  the primary key cannot  be changed.  This is
% 			known as a tombstone delete,  which prevents deleting a primary key or
% 			changing it. 
% 		
% 		
% 		
% 			\item [Case B: Update  Foreign Key]  where  the \texttt{ValidationHandler}
% 			is used to check if the foreign keys can be updated and
% 			the respective getter and setter methods of the entity are used to perform the
% 			changes. 
% 			
% 			\item [Case C: Update Attributes]  where a normal update takes place as long as
% 			the attributes  are not keys or referenced anywhere.
% 			
% 		\end{description}
		
		
% 		one in which ,   another in which the foriegn keys are changed
% 		and lastly the one in which attributes that are not keys or referenced anywhere
% 		are changed.  In the former case,  the attribute \texttt{keyForUpdate} is used to
% 		indicate the change in the primary key.  In the case where forieng keys are
% 		updated,   respective getter and setter methods of the  entity are used to
% 		perform the changes.  In both these cases,  referential
% 		integrity needs to be ensured. 
% 		
% % 		it uses the primary key of the entity to update it,  and the other one in which
% % 		uses the especial field \texttt{keyForUpdate} to update the primary as well as
% % 		the rest of the fields. 
% 		 
% 		When the entity to be updated does not contain a change in its keys,  a normal
% 		update takes place using its getter and setter methods.   
		
		
		\subsubsection{Delete}\label{ss:delete}
		The  \texttt{Delete} operation removes  an entity from its respective column
		family.  As mentioned before,  primary key values  will never cease to exist
		in Cassandra due to the tombstone delete, hence, this operation
		empties the values of the columns represented within the entity to be deleted.
		Even when primary key values exist within the column families for deleted
		entities, these are ignored on \texttt{read} operations.
		
		The \texttt{Delete} operation triggers referential
		integrity validations every time an entity is deleted.  
		 This validation is performed by the \texttt{onDelete} method of the
		 \texttt{ValidationHandler}.  Finally,  if the
		\texttt{ValidationHandler} allows it, the \texttt{EntityManager} passes the
		 necessary information to the \texttt{delete} method of the Hector
		 \texttt{Mutator} object. This operation is detailed in
		 Algorithm~\ref{a:em:delete}.
 		
 		\begin{algorithm}[H]
			\caption{Delete algorithm in \texttt{EntityManager}}\label{a:em:delete}
% 			\SetKwInOut{Input}{input}\SetKwInOut{Output}{output}
			\SetKwFunction{onDelete}{onDelete}
			\SetKwFunction{delete}{delete}
			\SetKwData{e}{e} \SetKwData{Mutator}{Mutator}
			\SetKwData{validationHandler}{validationHandler}
			\KwIn{\texttt{Entity} \e to delete}
			\Begin{
				invoke \onDelete on \validationHandler passing entity \e ;\\
				
				\If{no exception is thrown}{
					retrieve attributes  of \e;\\
					invoke \delete on \Mutator passing primary key  and column family
					of \e;\\
				}			
			}
			
		\end{algorithm}
		
 		
%  		Before a parent entity is deleted,  the \texttt{EntityManager} retrieves the
%  		child entities it depends upon  from he \texttt{ValidationHandler} if the
%  		 referential intergity is not violated.  The \texttt{EntityManager} deletes
%  		the child entities prior to deleting the parent entity. 
		
		
		
		
		\subsection{ValidationHandler}\label{ss:VH}
		The \texttt{ValidationHandler} is used by the \texttt{EntityManager} every time
		an operation triggers  referential integrity validations on any entity.
		It contains the  logic that  checks  if an entity has dependencies,
		verifies whether the \texttt{insert}, \texttt{update} or
		\texttt{delete} operations performed on an entity  violate  referential
		integrity constraints, and it also applies referential integrity rules
		when operations are cascaded or updates nor deletes are allowed. 
		
		
% 		 In order to ensure that these operations maintain referential integrity
% 		  between entities,  it applies the appropriate referential integrity rules
% 		 explained in Section~\ref{s:referential-integrity}. Similarly,  for
%  		\texttt{update} and \texttt{delete} operations their respective rules are
%  		applied.   The referential integrity validation performed by the
% 		\texttt{ValidationHandler} for each of these operations is discussed next.
		
		The \texttt{ValidationHandler} is just an interface that has to be implemented
		to deal with each solution. However, since the validations are the same across
		solutions, it is sufficient to provide a generic
		class that implements the \texttt{ValidationHandler} for \ac{CRUD} operations.
		Thus, it is left for each solution to extend the generic
		\texttt{ValidationHandler} and just implement the \texttt{retrieveMetadata}
		method accordingly.
		
% 		Notice that, the \texttt{ValidationHandler} has access to the
% 		\texttt{EntityManager} in order to look-up for dependencies and metadata of an entity as soon as  validation is
% 		invoked on an entity.
% The \texttt{EntityManager} passes the entity and the connection details  to
% the \texttt{ValidationHandler} to perform the validation.
		
		
		
	
	\subsubsection{Validation: \texttt{onInsert}}
		This validation is triggered every time the \texttt{EntityManager} is asked to
		insert an entity. It occurs before the insertion of the actual data as the
		validation has to check whether the entity has foreign keys to other column
		families. This is determined by retrieving the  constraints relevant to the
		entity, and if a constraint indicates that the entity has foreign keys,
		this validation must ensure that they match the primary keys of the
		respective column families they reference. This validation is detailed in
		Algorithm~\ref{a:vh:onInsert}.
	
	 	\begin{algorithm}[H]
	 		\caption{Validation \texttt{onInsert}}\label{a:vh:onInsert}
	 		\SetKwData{e}{e}
	 		\SetKw{throw}{throw}
	 		\KwIn{\texttt{Entity} e to be inserted}
	 		\Begin{
	 			retrieve the metadata of \e;\\
	 			\ForEach{constraint of type \texttt{R} $\in$ metadata}{
					retrieve referenced constraint \texttt{RConstraintName};\\
					determine the entity class that maps to the parent column family;\\
					use \texttt{EntityManager} to find parent entity;\\
					\If{parent entity does not exist}{
						\throw Exception;\\
					}
	 			}
	 		}
	 	\end{algorithm}
	 	
	 	
For example,  when an \texttt{Enrolment} entity is to be inserted,   the
 \texttt{ValidationHandler} identifies the parent column families  by looking up
 at the \ac{FK} constraints of the entity. In this case, there
 is only \texttt{CONST400} which identifies \texttt{Student} as a parent column
 family. Hence, the \texttt{ValidationHandler} makes sure there is a
 \texttt{Student} entity whose primary key value matches the foreign key value
 of the \texttt{Enrolment} entity to be inserted. If such a parent entity
 exists, then the \texttt{EntityManager} is allowed to \texttt{insert} the entity.
		
		
	\subsection{Validation: \texttt{onUpdate}}
		This validation is triggered every time the \texttt{EntityManager} is asked to
		update an entity which primary key value has changed. Recall that if the
		changes of the entity to  be updated do not involve the primary key, then an
		\texttt{insert} takes place instead and hence the validation is performed by
		\texttt{onInsert}. Otherwise, if the primary key value of the entity is
		changed, the new entity is  inserted, the foreign keys of the dependencies are
		updated to the new primary key value, and the old entity is deleted.
		 Clearly, the referential integrity rules apply in this validation. These are 
		 assumed to be contained within the  \texttt{DeleteRule} field of the
		 constraints relevant to the children entities.  Thus, the validation finds
		  all the child dependencies of the entity and, if the \texttt{DeleteRule} is
		  \texttt{CASCADE}, updates their corresponding foreign keys to the new
		  primary key value. Otherwise, if the \texttt{DeleteRule} is
		  \texttt{NODELETE}, the update is only allowed if there are no child
		  dependencies. Notice that this operation assumes the entity with new primary
		  key value has already been inserted. This validation is detailed in
		  Algorithm~\ref{a:vh:onUpdate}.
		
		\begin{algorithm}[H]
			\caption{Validation \texttt{onUpdate}}\label{a:vh:onUpdate}
	 		\SetKwData{e}{e}
	 		\SetKw{throw}{throw}
	 		\KwIn{\texttt{Entity} e to be updated}
	 		\Begin{
	 			retrieve the metadata of \e;\\
	 			\ForEach{constraint of type \texttt{F} $\in$ metadata}{
					retrieve referenced constraint \texttt{RConstraintName};\\
					\If{\texttt{DeleteRule} is \texttt{CASCADE}}{
						determine the entity class that maps to the child column family;\\
						use \texttt{EntityManager} to query for the children of \e;\\
						add children to list;\\
					}\ElseIf{\texttt{DeleteRule} is \texttt{NODELETE}}{
						determine the entity class that maps to the child column family;\\
						use \texttt{EntityManager} to query for the children of \e;\\
						\If{\e has children}{
							\throw Exception;
						}
					}
	 			}
	 			\ForEach{child $\in$ list}{
	 				use \texttt{EntityManager} to update child;
	 			}
	 		}
		\end{algorithm}
		
		
		
For example,   in the University keyspace,   if the primary key of a 
		\texttt{Course} entity is to be updated,    the \texttt{ValidationHandler}
locates the \ac{FK} constraints which reference \texttt{Course}. In this case,
only \texttt{CONST600} references \texttt{Course}, which follows up to
\texttt{CONST500} from which the child entity can be retrieved.
Since the \texttt{DeleteRule} is \texttt{NODELETE}, it is checked if there are
any \texttt{Enrolment} entities which reference the course to be updated. If
there are child entities, an exception is thrown and the update of the
\texttt{Course} entity is not allowed. Otherwise, if no \texttt{Enrolment}
entities refer to such a course, the \texttt{EntityManager} is allowed to update
its primary key value.
		
		
	\subsubsection{Validation: \texttt{onDelete}}
		This validation is triggered every time the \texttt{EntityManager} is asked 
		to delete an entity. This validation ensures that referential integrity rules
		are applied when the entity is referenced by other entities. That is, the
		entity to be deleted is parent of other entities. The referential integrity
		rule to apply can be \texttt{CASCADE} or \texttt{NODELETE}. In the former
		case, child dependencies on the entity are deleted, while deletion in the
		latter case is only allowed when the entity has no child dependencies. This
		validation is detailed in Algorithm~\ref{a:vh:onDelete}.
		
		\begin{algorithm}[H]
	 		\caption{Validation \texttt{onDelete}}\label{a:vh:onDelete}
	 		\SetKwData{e}{e}
	 		\SetKw{throw}{throw}
	 		\KwIn{\texttt{Entity} e to be deleted}
	 		\Begin{
	 			retrieve the metadata of \e;\\
	 			\ForEach{constraint of type \texttt{F} $\in$ metadata}{
					retrieve referenced constraint \texttt{RConstraintName};\\
					\If{\texttt{DeleteRule} is \texttt{CASCADE}}{
						determine the entity class that maps to the child column family;\\
						use \texttt{EntityManager} to query for the children of \e;\\
						add children to list;\\
					}\ElseIf{\texttt{DeleteRule} is \texttt{NODELETE}}{
						determine the entity class that maps to the child column family;\\
						use \texttt{EntityManager} to query for the children of \e;\\
						\If{\e has children}{
							\throw Exception;
						}
					}
	 			}
	 			\ForEach{child $\in$ list}{
	 				use \texttt{EntityManager} to delete child;
	 			}
	 		} 
	 	\end{algorithm}
		
		For example,   in the University keyspace,   if a 
		\texttt{Student} entity is requested to be deleted,    the
		\texttt{ValidationHandler} locates the \ac{FK} constraints which reference \texttt{Student}. In this
		 case, only \texttt{CONST700} references \texttt{Student}, which follows up
		 to \texttt{CONST400} from which the child entity can be retrieved.
		Since the \texttt{DeleteRule} is \texttt{Cascade},  
		the child entities are deleted from \texttt{Enrolment} and no exception
		is thrown, hence allowing the \texttt{EntityManager} to  delete the
		entity from its \texttt{Student} column family.

		The \texttt{ValidationHandler} has access to the \texttt{EntityManager} in order
		to look-up for dependencies and metadata of an entity as soon as  validation is
		invoked on an entity.
% The \texttt{EntityManager} passes the entity and the connection details  to
% the \texttt{ValidationHandler} to perform the validation.
		
		The \texttt{ValidationHandler} contains the  logic for checking whether an
		entity has any dependencies and verifies whether  \texttt{insert},
		\texttt{update} or \texttt{delete} operations  violate  referential integrity or
		not.   In order to ensure that these operations maintain referential integrity
		between entities,  it applies the appropriate referential integrity rules
		explained in Section~\ref{s:referential-integrity}. Similarly,  for
		\texttt{update} and \texttt{delete} operations their respective rules are
		applied.   The referential integrity validation performed by the
		\texttt{ValidationHandler} for each of these operations is discussed next.
		
	\begin{description}
	\item[onInsert:]
		In an \texttt{insert} operation,  a referential integrity validation is
		triggered before an entity is  inserted. The \texttt{ValidationHandler}  checks
		whether the entity has foreign keys and, if so, whether these refer to valid
		parent entities. That is,  it ensures that the foreign keys of the entity to
		insert match primary keys.  Otherwise, an exception is raised stating that the
		referential integrity has been violated. The following checks are performed by
		the \texttt{ValidationHandler}.
		
		\renewcommand{\labelenumii}{\arabic{enumi}. \arabic{enumii}}
		\renewcommand{\labelenumiii}{\arabic{enumi}. \arabic{enumii}. \arabic{enumiii}}
		
		\begin{enumerate}
		\item If the entity has no \ac{FK} constraints
				\begin{enumerate}
		  		\item \texttt{EntityManager} inserts the entity. 
		  		\end{enumerate}
				
		\item Else,  if the entity has \ac{FK} constraints 
		  		\begin{enumerate}
				\item Identify the parent entity class from the \ac{FK} constraint. 
				\item If foreign keys exist as  primary key in the parent entity class
				  		\begin{enumerate}
				  		\item \texttt{EntityManager} inserts the entity. 
				  		\end{enumerate}
				\item Else
				   		\begin{enumerate}
				   		  \item Raise exception. 
				   		\end{enumerate}
				\end{enumerate}   	
		\end{enumerate}
		The implementation of the \texttt{insert} operation is consistent across all the
		solutions.  
		
	\item[onUpdate:] 
		In an \texttt{update} operation,  a referential integrity validation is
		triggered before the state of an entity is changed.  The validation for an
		\texttt{update} operation is different according to whether primary keys,
		foreign keys or just regular attributes are updated.
		
		\begin{description}
		\item[Case A: Update Primary Key] When a  primary key of a
		parent entity is updated,  the \texttt{ValidationHandler} performs the
		following checks. 
		\renewcommand{\labelenumii}{\arabic{enumi}. \arabic{enumii}}
		\renewcommand{\labelenumiii}{\arabic{enumi}. \arabic{enumii}. \arabic{enumiii}}
		%\renewcommand{\labelenumiiii}{\arabic{enumi}. \arabic{enumii}. \arabic{enumiii}. \arabic{enumiiii}}
		\begin{enumerate}
		  \item If the entity has no \ac{FK} constraints 
		  	\begin{enumerate}
		  		  \item \texttt{EntityManager}  updates the entity. 
			\end{enumerate}		  	
		  \item Else if the entity has  \ac{FK} constraints  
		  		\begin{enumerate}		  	
				  \item If the \texttt{DeleteRule} for the \ac{FK} constraint is
				  \texttt{Cascade}
				    	\begin{enumerate}
				    	  \item Use \texttt{EntityManager} to
				    	   update the primary key of the entity and the foreign keys of the
				    	   child entities. 
						\end{enumerate}
				  \item Else,  if the \texttt{DeleteRule}  is
				  \texttt{NoDelete}\footnote{{Notice that \texttt{DeleteRule} is considered as the rules applied on
				  \texttt{update} operations for brevity and simplicity.}}
						\begin{enumerate}
						  \item If the entity has no child entities,  
% 						  		\begin{enumerate}
						  		   \texttt{EntityManager}  updates the entity. 
% 						  		\end{enumerate}
						  \item Else,  if the entity has child entities,  
% 						   		\begin{enumerate}
						    	  Raise exception.  
% 						    	\end{enumerate}
						\end{enumerate}
				\end{enumerate}
		 \end{enumerate}
		 
		For example,   in the University keyspace,   when a
		 \texttt{keyForUpdate} is provided for an existing  \texttt{Student}
		entity,   the \texttt{ValidationHandler}
		checks the metadata and locates the \ac{FK} constraint \texttt{CONST400} as
		seen in Figure~\ref{f:metadataInSolutions}.  Since the \texttt{DeleteRule} is
		\texttt{Cascade},  the \texttt{ValidationHandler} allows the \texttt{update}
		operation to take place as explained in Section~\ref{ss:Implementation-API-EntityManager}. 
			
% 			For example,  when the foreign key \texttt{StudentId} for one of the entities
% 		in \texttt{Enrolment} is given a new value,   then the \texttt{ValidationHandler} 
% 		identifies the parent entity class for its \ac{FK} constraint
% 		\texttt{CONST400} as \texttt{Student}.   If the new \texttt{StudentId} 
% 		exists as a primary key for any
% 		 of the  entities in \texttt{Student} entity class,   the \texttt{update} is
% 		 performed.

% \input{chapter/Experimental}
		\item[Case B: Update Foreign Key] When a foreign key of a child entity is
		updated,  the  \texttt{ValidationHandler} checks  the
		metadata and locates its \ac{FK} constraints.  It then follows these steps:
		\begin{enumerate}
		  \item Identify parent entity class from the \ac{FK} constraint. 
		  \item If the new foreign key exists as primary key in the parent entity
		  class
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item \texttt{EntityManager} updates  the foreign key. 
			\end{enumerate}
		  \item Else 
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item Raise exception. 
			\end{enumerate}
		\end{enumerate}
		
		\item[Case C: Update Attributes] When an attribute which is neither a primary
		key nor a foreign key is updated, the \texttt{ValidationHandler} performs no
		validations and allows the \texttt{EntityManager} to update the entity. 
		
		\end{description}
		
		The implementation of the \texttt{update} operation for these cases is
		consistent across all the solutions. 
		
	\item[onDelete:] 
		In a \texttt{delete} operation, a referential
		integrity validation is triggered before an entity is deleted.  The
		\texttt{ValidationHandler} applies the referential integrity delete rule
		and performs the following checks:
		\renewcommand{\labelenumii}{\arabic{enumi}. \arabic{enumii}}
		\renewcommand{\labelenumiii}{\arabic{enumi}. \arabic{enumii}. \arabic{enumiii}}
		
		\begin{enumerate}
% 		  \item Identify existing \ac{FK} constraints on the entity. 
		  \item If the entity has no \ac{FK} constraints 
		  		\begin{enumerate}
				  \item \texttt{EntityManager} deletes the entity. 
				\end{enumerate}
		  \item Else if the entity has \ac{FK} constraints 
				\begin{enumerate}
		  		  \item If \texttt{DeleteRule} is \texttt{Cascade}
		  		 		\begin{enumerate}
		  		 		   \item Use \texttt{EntityManager}
		  		 		   to delete the entity and its child entities. 
		  		 		\end{enumerate}
		  		  \item Else if \texttt{DeleteRule}  is \texttt{NoDelete}
						\begin{enumerate}
						  \item If no child entities exist,
% 						  		\begin{enumerate}
						  		   \texttt{EntityManager} deletes the entity. 
% 						  		\end{enumerate}
						  \item Else if child entities exist,
% 						   		\begin{enumerate}
						    		 Raise exception.  
% 						    	\end{enumerate}
						\end{enumerate}
		  		\end{enumerate}
		\end{enumerate}	
		For example,   in the University keyspace,   if a 
		\texttt{Student} entity is marked for
		deletion,  the \texttt{ValidationHandler} locates the \ac{FK} constraint 
		\texttt{CONST400} referencing \texttt{Student}. 
		Since the \texttt{DeleteRule} is \texttt{Cascade},  
		the child entities are deleted from \texttt{Enrolment} prior to deleting the
		entity from its \texttt{Student} column family.  
	\end{description}
		
%  Since metadata is stored differently in the solutions,  the operation for
% retrieving the metadata in the  \texttt{ValidationHandler} is different for
% each solution in the \ac{API}. 
% For example,   the \texttt{ValidationHandler} for Solution 1 and 2 involves
% parsing the metadata  since it is stored as a \texttt{String} along with the
% actual data while in Solution 3 and 4 it is saved as an entity class. 
	The referential integrity validation logic,  the implementation of the \ac{CRUD}
	operations and the connection settings of Cassandra  are common for
	all the solutions in the \ac{API}.  However,  the metadata access,  retrieval and
	processing are unique to each solution and handled accordingly.  The following
	sections describe how metadata is  
	accessed and processed in the \ac{API}. 
% how metadata is accessed and retrieved and the motivation for the solution's
% design.
