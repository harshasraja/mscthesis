\chapter{Design of Referential Integrity Constraints in NoSQL
databases} \label{c:solutions}

% As mentioned previously,   cloud column-oriented key-value \acp{DBMS} lack
% referential integrity constraints to maintain foreign key relationships,   as
% seen in traditional \acp{RDBMS},   due to its non-relational data model.  
% Moreover,   these cloud \acp{DBMS} do not normalise data nor maintain
% relationships. 
Traditionally,  referential
integrity constraints are imposed on data items of a database to maintain
foreign key relationships.  These relationships are
 maintained by correctly identifying and preserving the data dependencies 
 existing between the data items. 
% Traditionally,  foreign key relationships are
% maintained by correctly identifying and preserving the data dependencies existing between data items in a database. 
% These dependencies are maintained and  validated by imposing referential
% integrity constraints on data items.  
Most popular traditional \acp{RDBMS}
preserve such dependency information in their \texttt{System} tables or data
dictionaries.   These tables store the necessary information  which is required
to maintain valid dependencies.  The information stored in such tables include table
names,   primary and foreign keys, among others. 
This can be seen in popular \acp{RDBMS} like  MS SQL Server,   PostgreSQL, 
Oracle,  and so on.   

For example,   in MS SQL Server 2000,  \texttt{sysforeignkeys}
is a \texttt{System} table which stores the information of all 
foreign keys of every table in a database,  and \texttt{sysreferences}
stores the mappings of  foreign keys to the referenced primary key columns
(\todo{\citep{sys:msdn}}). 
Information in these \texttt{System} tables consist of  the
names of tables and its constraints,   unique identifiers of 
referenced and referencing columns and others.  
In PostgreSQL,  such information is presented to users as views but it is stored
in base tables which contain the dependency information of data items in a database.
The view \texttt{table\_constraints} contains the information for all the
constraints in every table owned by the current user.  (\todo{\cite{}}).  
Similarly,  Oracle uses a \texttt{SYSTEM} meta-database to hold such constraint
information. 
 In general,  \texttt{System} tables or views with information
about the existing dependencies  are looked up by these \acp{RDBMS} whenever
referential integrity checks are triggered \citep{sys:msdn}. 


The solutions presented in this thesis save the dependency information as
metadata.  This metadata contains relevant  information about  foreign
key relationships in keyspaces and primary keys of column families.  It is
accessed whenever an operation is performed on the data and referential
integrity needs to be validated. 


This chapter presents the design of  four  solutions  that implement referential
integrity constraints in a cloud \ac{NoSQL} \ac{DBMS}. 
Section~\ref{s:design-Metadata} describes the metadata used by the solutions 
 to store the dependency information.  Section~\ref{s:design-sol1} presents the
 design of the first solution.  Section~\ref{s:design-sol2} presents Solution~2
 and its design and motivation.  Section~\ref{s:design-sol3} describes the design
 and motivation of Solution 3.  Section~\ref{s:design-sol4} presents the design
 and motivation of Solution~4.  Finally,  Section~\ref{s:Design-summary}
 summarises the design of the four solutions. 
 % Section~\ref{s:API} describes the design and implementation of the experimental
% API developed to integrate all the four
% solutions.  
% Section~\ref{s:sol1} describes  the first solution,  which implements
% referential integrity constraints by saving metadata along with the actual data. 
% Section~\ref{s:sol2} describes the second  solution where metadata is
% saved as a top row.  Section~\ref{s:sol3} describes the third   
% solution which saves metadata separate from the actual data.    
% Section~\ref{s:sol4}  describes the fourth solution which saves metadata in a separate cluster. 
% Finally,  Section~\ref{s:solutions-summary} presents a brief summary of this
% chapter.

\section{Summary}\label{s:Design-summary}
The significant difference in the design of all the  solutions is the way each
of the solutions store metadata.  Solution~1 stores metadata with the data in
every super column providing easier access to the metadata but increases its
redundancy . 
Solution~2 has a similar approach as Solution~1 but stores metadata in a single
super column in every column family. This approach is useful when the metadata
is large for a column family since it consumes lesser space when compared to Solution~1.
Solution~3 separates the metadata from
the actual data and stores all the constraints of all the column families in a
keyspace together in a centralised way.  This is useful when metadata has to be
amended or altered. 
Moreover this also removes handling the actual data each time metadata has to be
accessed.  
Solution~4 has a similar approach as Solution~3 but saves the \texttt{Metadata}
column family in a separate cluster on different nodes.  It also introduces
caching the metadata  to save operational time and reduce database connections. 

The way metadata is accessed and processed are different in each of the
solutions since metadata storage is unique in each  solution.  The way the
experimental \ac{API} retrieves and processes the metadata in each solution and
how it handles all the \ac{CRUD} operations and the referential integrity validations 
are discussed in detail in Chapter~\ref{c:Implementation}. 
% It also explains how each of the solutions retrieves and processes the
% metadata. 

% The insert,  update and delete operations are performed similar to the other
% solutions. 


% These methods and all the
% solutions are incorporated  into an experimental \ac{API},  which is
% described in Chapter~\ref{c:Implementation}.
