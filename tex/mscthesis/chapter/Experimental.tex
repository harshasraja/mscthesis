\todo{Check number of enrolments, introduce all metadata, and retrieve 
details of cassandra cluster from my computer}

The implementation of the four solutions  introduces referential integrity
constraints and validations in Cassandra, which are 
not provided by this \ac{DBMS} at the moment of writing. In order to evaluate
 the performance of these four solutions, experiments are 
  conducted by using the implemented \ac{API} described in
  Section~\todo{Section}.   The goal of the experiments is to determine how
  each solution affects the performance of  Cassandra in \ac{CRUD}
  operations, especifically in those where referential integrity validations are
  triggered (namely Create, Update and Delete).

The experimentation is performed on the example application presented across
chapters: the University keyspace. In such an application, different constraints
are added and allow to test the performance under such different application
requirements. The performance of the  solutions provided for ensuring
referential integrity  is measured based on response time and throughput.

This chapter is structured as follows.
Section~\ref{sexp:BenchmarkKeyspace} describes the example application 
used for the experiments. Section~\ref{sexp:CassandraCluster} provides the
details of the nodes used in the Cassandra cluster. Section~\ref{sexp:ExperimentalSetup}
describes the experimental setup to evaluate the performance of the solutions.
Section~\ref{sexp:PerformanceIndicators} presents the performance indicators
 considered for measuring the results from the experiments. Finally,
Section~\ref{sexp:Summary} presents a summary of the chapter.


\section{Example application} \label{sexp:BenchmarkKeyspace}
% In order to asses the performance of Cassandra when the four solutions are
% executed,
% In the experiments, the experimental \ac{API} is implemented by loading
% entitites belonging to a prototype keyspace designed for these experiments. The
% prototype keyspace is modelled on a University keyspace that stores the details
% of students and courses along with the enrolment details of the students.The
% class diagram for the University keyspace is shown in
% Figure~\ref{fexp:ClassDiagram}. The entities are saved as the following column
% families in Cassandra.

The  \ac{API} designed and implemented in the previous chapters is validated and
tested by performing \ac{CRUD} operations on an example application
especifically designed for this purpose. This application has been referred to
as the \texttt{University} keyspace in previous chapters, and it contains
different constraints in order to  assess the performance of the \ac{API} and
the solutions on each of them. This application stores the details of students and
 courses along with the enrolment details of the students. The class diagram for
 the University keyspace is shown in Figure~\ref{fexp:ClassDiagram}, and each
 entity is saved into its respective column family in a Cassandra cluster.

	\begin{itemize}
	  \item \texttt{Student} stores the  following attributes of students:
	   \texttt{StudentId} (primary key), \texttt{FirstName}, \texttt{LastName},
	  \texttt{Email} and \texttt{Age}.
	  \item \texttt{Course} stores  the following  attributes of courses:
	  \texttt{CourseId} (primary key), \texttt{CourseName}, \texttt{Trimester},
	  \texttt{Level} and \texttt{Year}.
	  \item \texttt{Enrolment} stores the  relationship between
	  students and courses, that is, it stores the courses each student is enrolled
	  into.  The attributes for \texttt{Enrolment} are \texttt{RowId} (primary
	  key), \texttt{StudentId} and \texttt{CourseId}, where \texttt{StudentId}
	  and \texttt{CourseId} are foreign keys.
	\end{itemize}

% The constraints for the keyspace are stored in  a  \texttt{Metadata} entity
% class.These constraints are the \ac{PK} and \ac{FK} constraints applicable on each of
% the column families in this keyspace. The list of constraints are the same for
% all the solutions  and are shown in Table~\ref{texp:ListConstraints}.

\section{Cassandra cluster} \label{sexp:CassandraCluster}
Cassandra is deployed in an homogeneous cluster conformed by 10 nodes. That is,
 all 10 nodes have the same characteristics in software and hardware. These
 nodes emulate a cloud environment in which each node saves
 the data on the local disks of the machines. The characteristics of these nodes
are:


\begin{itemize}
  \item Hardware: \todo{Look on internet the specs of the model}
  	\begin{itemize}
  	  
  	 \end{itemize}
  \item Software: 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Operating system
    \item Java JDK
    \item Cassandra version
    \item Hector version
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Cassandra configurations:

Version: 0.8.4

Hector Version: 0.8.0-2

Replication strategy:

Partitioner used: Random Partitioner which distrbutes rows in a cluster evenly.
This is the default configuration setting when Cassandra is installed.

The configurations on all the modes are set to the default values in the yaml
configuration file.

The first node is started as a seed node and has the Auto Bootstrap option set
to true. This allows other nodes with this ndoe as its seed to migrate data from
the seed node while data partitioning. For the rest of the nodes tihs options is
set to false.Hinted Handoff is enabled on all nodes.

\section{Summary} \label{sexp:Summary} 

This chapter  presented the experimental design to evaluate the performance of
each  solution and the experimental \ac{API} itself using the prototype keyspace
that is used as an example across this thesis.  The experimental design involves
assessing the performance of the CRUD operations on the different solutions
proposed for referential integrity. 
The analysis of results is to be based on response time and throughput,  two
performance indicators that serve as guidelines for assessing the trade-offs
between the different solutions proposed. 
	
	
The next chapter presents the results and their discussions of the experimental
design presented in this chapter
