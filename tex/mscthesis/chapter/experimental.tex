\section{Cassandra cluster}

The environment to deploy cassandra is  an homogeneous cluster conformed by 10
nodes. That is, all 10 nodes have the same characteristics in software and
hardware. These nodes emulate a cloud environment in which each node runs
Cassandra. The characteristics of these nodes are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Hardware
  \item Software
\end{itemize}



\section{Experimental setup}
	The experiments to evaluate the performance on the cluster consist on 
	inserting, updating, and deleting data using each of the solutions.    
	runs in which each performs
