\section{Cloud Data Models}\label{s:cloud-data-models}
Data models describe the structure of a database and give the users information
on how a database can be used or implemented.  On the cloud,   different types
of data models exist.  The selection of a data model for a cloud database
depends on the problem the cloud database is specialised to address or a feature
it is incorporating.  Some of the current popular data models on the cloud are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Key Value data model 

\item Document data model 

\item Relational data model
\end{itemize}

In general,   cloud \acp{DBMS} are non-relational and most cloud \acp{DBMS}
adopt the key-value data model to maintain the data replication,   consistency
and scalability that are part of cloud data storage (\todo{cite 440}). The
key-value databases,   document databases and other databases that support
non-relational data models on the cloud are loosely termed as \ac{NoSQL}
databases.  \ac{NoSQL} \acp{DBMS} are considered the next generation cloud
\acp{DBMS} that aim to provide non-relational distributed \acp{DBMS} with
open-source content and development for the cloud (\ac{NoSQL},   n. d. ) Many
\ac{NoSQL} \acp{DBMS},   that are inherently key-value \acp{DBMS},   have
evolved by adopting various features from other popular cloud \ac{NoSQL}
\acp{DBMS}.  For example,   Cassandra adopts the column oriented data model of
Google's Bigtable~\citep{bigtable} while Riak (\todo{cite 440}) is influenced by
Amazon's Dynamo~\citep{Dynamo}.  This thesis focuses on the column-oriented
key-value data model and is explained in Section~\ref{s:key-value-data-model}.

Although \acp{RDBMS} on the cloud are not widely used,   there exist some cloud
capable \acp{RDBMS} like Amazon Relational Data Service,   Microsoft SQL Azure
etc.  Just like the traditional relational model,   relational model on the
cloud also supports relations or tables with rows and columns to store
structured data and adheres to a schema.  These \acp{RDBMS} provide users with
database administration facilities and APIs to scale relational databases and to
perform operations on stored data,   like updating,   inserting,   deleting data
etc.  The cloud \acp{RDBMS} offered today vary according to the vendors and each
of the vendors propose alternative solutions to problems like scalability and
latency.  However,   the replication of data is restrained due to the relational
nature of \acp{RDBMS} and this reduced replication affects the scalability and
performance as well.  
% Most cloud \ac{RDBMS} are outperformed by \ac{NoSQL}
% \acp{DBMS} (\todo{cite}).

% Motivated by such problems of data dependencies,   this thesis studies the
% existing modelling of data dependencies in cloud \ac{NoSQL} database systems and
% aims to contribute by suggesting four solutions so that referential integrity
% is effectively maintained,   while also not limiting the benefits of not having
% a rigid schema in \ac{NoSQL} database systems.  Such a result would reduce the
% workload of the applications or the persistence layers of the application
% servers.  Additionally it would give users of \ac{NoSQL} database systems
% better consistency in data,   along with ensuring better data integrity even when
% it is widely replicated or spread on different data-centers. 


% These proposed solutions are deployed and analysed in Cassandra,  which is a
% column-oriented key-value \ac{DBMS}. To implement any solution it is necessary
% to understand the architecture and the key operations allowed in a \ac{DBMS}.
% For this purpose,  the architecture of Cassandra is discussed in the following section.



\section{Summary}



This chapter presented the background about the underlying concepts in cloud
computing and cloud databases.  It is clear that cloud computing is gaining
prevalence due to its many benefits like high data availability, cheap
storage, and others.  With an increase in the number of users
migrating to cloud computing,   cloud data storage is gaining prominence as well,  
for easy and simple data storage.  This has paved the way for the existence
of many different data models and databases on the cloud.  Amongst the many data
models, the key-value data model has been  most widely used  on the cloud
as it is more adapted to the cloud environment due to its support for
replication and scalability and other cloud related features (\todo{cite}). 



This chapter also discussed a few  architectural concepts of Cassandra that form
its foundation , providing it with BASE properties and many important features like
high data availability, failure management, fault tolerance and scalability
among others.  
The architectural concepts and operations of Cassandra are designed to
make it a highly available and scalable \ac{DBMS}.
Cassandra is used to implement the four solutions
designed to impose referential integrity validations in cloud \ac{NoSQL}
\acp{DBMS}.  The design of these solutions  and the approaches used to
implement such validations are explained in the following chapter. 


% The next chapter describes the four solutions proposed to enforce referential
% integrity constraints in cloud \ac{NoSQL} \acp{DBMS},   particularly in
% Cassandra which is based on the column-oriented key-value data model.
