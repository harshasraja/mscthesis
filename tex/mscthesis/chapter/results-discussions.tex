\chapter{Results and Discussions}
 

The performance of the solutions is measured in terms of response time and
throughput while validating referential integrity in the experiments.  Response e
time and throughput are common \ac{DBMS} performance indicators.  The response
time  indicates the time taken for an operation to be completed  while
throughput measures the number of operations that can be  completed in a unit of
time. 
The performance of the operations when referential integrity validations are not
enforced is also measured and considered as the baseline with which the
solutions are compared.   Such a comparison determines the difference in
performance  when such additional validations are enforced using the \ac{API}
and provides a guideline to asses the performance impact of each solution. 

The results from the experiments are analysed and discussed in this chapter. 
Section~\ref{s:results-overview} presents an overview of the  performance of the
four solutions.  
Section~\ref{s:results-Baseline} presents the performance without referential
integrity validations.  
Sections~\ref{s:results-insert},  ~\ref{s:results-update}
and~\ref{s:results-Delete} compares the results
of all the solutions for the \texttt{insert},   \texttt{update} and
\texttt{delete} operations (respectively).   
% Section presents the analysis for the \texttt{update}
% operation for all the solutions.  
% Section discusses the results of the solutions for the
% \texttt{delete} operation.  
Section~\ref{s:comparisonOfOperations} presents an overall comparison of the
operations.  
 Finally,   Section~\ref{s:results-summary} presents a summary of this chapter.

% Moreover,   when the experiments are run \texttt{insert} on these entities are
% the first operations to take place and the results can be slightly influenced
% by the initialisation of the column families and the keyspace.   However,   the
% difference is small and only a fraction of a millisecond. 
% the number  of columns that are updated in \texttt{Enrolment} is much lesser
% than the other column families.   This means that \texttt{update} on
% \texttt{Enrolment} involves fewer search by indexes and writes for the new
% values,   to be precise it involves only three searches and writes to update
% its three columns.    On the other hand,  \texttt{Student} and \texttt{Course}
% column families have more number of columns to be updated in each
% \texttt{update} operation. 

\section{Comparison of the Operations} \label{s:comparisonOfOperations}
 
In order to compare the operations,  their performance  is grouped by solutions
and presented in Figures~\ref{fres:ResponseTimeOfSolutions}
and~\ref{fres:ThroughputOfSolutions}. 
Generally,  the \texttt{insert} operation takes the least time across the
solutions as it does not involve any cascaded operations and referential
integrity constraints have to be satisfied only for the child entities.  This
involves ensuring the existence of foreign keys as primary keys in the parent
column families and then inserting the child entities into their respective
column families. 

On the other hand,   the \texttt{update} operation takes the most time  in every
solution,   mainly due to its cascaded behaviour on parent entities,   which
involves changing the parent primary key,   accessing child column families and
changing its foreign key values.  Note that \texttt{update} on \texttt{Enrolment}
is similar to \texttt{insert} on \texttt{Enrolment} across the solutions, 
because both operations involve checking whether the foreign keys exist in the
parent column families and inserting the values only in \texttt{Enrolment}. 
On the other hand,   \texttt{update} on parent entities (\texttt{Student} and
\texttt{Course})  take more time than inserting parent entities because
\texttt{update} involves additional searches and operations (\texttt{insert} and
\texttt{delete}) in both the parent and child column families. 

The \texttt{delete} operation is slower than the \texttt{insert} in the case of
parent entities and faster than \texttt{insert} in the case of child entities. 
This is because  referential integrity constraints have to be satisfied only in
the case of the  parent entities for this operation. 
% However,  inserting child entities require referential integrity constraints to
% be satisifed which makes \texttt{delete} faster than \texttt{insert} in the
% case of child entities. 
When \texttt{delete} and \texttt{update} operations are compared,  it can be seen
that the ratio of their performances  on the entities are similar,  which is
because both these operations are cascaded on parent entities. 
For example,  \texttt{update} on \texttt{Student} takes the most time amongst
entities,  and similarly,  \texttt{delete} on \texttt{Student} takes the most time
amongst the entities.  However,  in general,  deleting entities is faster than
updating them.  This is because updating entities involves more operations as
both \texttt{insert} and \texttt{delete} are performed on  child and
parent column families,  while deleting entities involves inserting empty values
in the place of the entity attributes to mark them as deleted (tombstone
effect).  Moreover,  in \texttt{update},  referential integrity constraints
have to satisfied for both parent and child entities,  but in
\texttt{delete},  these have to be satisfied only for the parent entities. 

Further information about the results for the operations and solutions are
provided in Appendices~\ref{apx:insert},  \ref{apx:update},  and
~\ref{apx:delete}. 


% Conversely,  deleting child entities is faster than inserting child entities
% because referential integrity constraints. 
%  
%  inserting parent entities do not cause referential integrity validations,   but
%  deleting them does.   Conversely,   deleting child entities is faster than
% inserting child entities since it does not trigger such validations. 

% 
% Across all solutions,  the \texttt{insert}
% operation is the one that has best performance when it comes to \texttt{Student}
% and \texttt{Course} as these entities do not have referential integrity
% constraints to be satisfied.  Such is not the case for \texttt{Enrolment}
% entities as these have foreign key values that reference entities in
% \texttt{Student} and \texttt{Course}.  Hence,  the referential integrity
% validation ensures that 
% 
% 
% 
% From these figures it can be seen that the
% \texttt{insert} operation  takes the least time to complete when compared
% to \texttt{update} and \texttt{delete} operations.   This is mainly because in
% \texttt{insert},  validations are triggered on only the \texttt{Enrolment} column
% family. 
% 
% On the other hand,   the \texttt{update} operation takes the most time  in every
% solution,   mainly due to its cascaded behaviour on parent entities,   which
% involves changing the parent primary key,   accessing child column families and
% changing its foreign key values. 
% Note that \texttt{update} on \texttt{Enrolment} is similar to \texttt{insert} on
% \texttt{Enrolment} because both operations involve checking whether the foreign
% keys exist in the parent column families and inserting the values only in
% \texttt{Enrolment}. 
% However,   \texttt{update} on \texttt{Student} and  \texttt{Course} entities take
% more time than inserting students and courses because \texttt{update} involves
% additional searches and operations (\texttt{insert} and \texttt{delete})
% in more than one column family.  
% 
% The \texttt{delete} operation is faster than \texttt{update} in all the
% solutions since entities are not immediately deleted due to the tombstone
% paradigm in Cassandra.   Moreover,  it involves only a single operation
% unlike the \texttt{update} operation which causes both an \texttt{insert} and a
%  \texttt{delete}.   Moreover,  deleting child entities do not cause validations
%  but updating any entity causes validations. 

% When compared with the \texttt{insert} operation,   \texttt{delete} is slower in
% the case of parent entities,   \texttt{Student} and \texttt{Course}.   This is
% because inserting parent entities do not cause referential integrity
% validations,   but deleting them does.   Conversely,   deleting child entities is
% faster than inserting child entities since it does not trigger such validations.

\section{Summary} \label{s:results-summary}

This chapter presented the results and discussions from the experiments designed
to evaluate the performance of the different \ac{CRUD} operations under
different referential integrity constraints in each of the solutions.
The results were assessed in terms of the average response time and throughput
of each operation. The results reflected that Solution~4 performs the best
amongst the solutions, and performs similar to the baseline when no referential
integrity constraints need to be satisfied (e.g. inserting parent entities),
because it caches the metadata and re-uses it to avoid multiple access to the
\texttt{Metadata} column family.
Solution~3 performs the worst amongst all and is slower than the baseline even
when no referential integrity constraints need to be satisfied because
simply accessing the metadata from a separate column family each time affects
its performance.
Solutions~1 and 2 perform similarly in all the operations on the entities which
is mainly because the metadata is embedded with the actual data.   Solution~2
consumes slightly more time than Solution~1 as it searches for the top row to
identify constraints on each operation.

The results showed that amongst the operations,   \texttt{insert} took the least
time while \texttt{update} took the most time,   and \texttt{delete} was faster
than \texttt{insert} only in the case of child entities.   These variations were
mainly due to the different referential integrity rules that are applied on
parent and child entities,   especially because of the \texttt{DeleteRule}
applied on these entities.  

The entities required different behaviours in each operation due to the various
referential integrity rules as well as  the data manipulation rules applied on
them.
\texttt{Enrolment} entities required to satisfy referential integrity
constraints during \texttt{insert} and \texttt{update} operations as it is a child entity,
while \texttt{Student} and \texttt{Course} are parent entities and required to
satisfy these constraints in both \texttt{update} and \texttt{delete}.   Thus,
parent entities are faster to operate upon in an \texttt{insert} operation,  
while child entities are faster only in a \texttt{delete} operation.
