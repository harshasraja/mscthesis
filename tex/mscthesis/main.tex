\begin{abstract}
\small

 Cloud data storage is an important and integral part of cloud computing, and
 has introduced a wave of change in the way data is stored today. Databases on
 cloud adopt data models and database architecture that are still evolving and
  very different from the popular and traditional data models like relational
  data model. This study reviews the different approaches cloud databases take
  to data organisation, by studying a few popular and widely used cloud
  databases. Cloud databases Bigtable, Amazon Dynamo, Cassandra, HBase and
  Microsoft SQL Azure are studied as a part of understanding general trends and
  architecture in cloud data storage. One of the databases, Cassandra is
  installed and used briefly to learn about accessing and using cloud data
  storages.This     study also covers the fundamental differences between cloud
  databases and the traditional \acp{RDBMS}.
