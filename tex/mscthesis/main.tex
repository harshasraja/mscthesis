\small

\ac{PSO} is a population-based algorithm inspired on social models and
swarm theory to solve combinatorial optimization problems.  Its simplicity,
robustness, flexibility, performance, and scalability, have encouraged its
applications to \acp{WSN}.  These networks are collections of interconnected
nodes that gather information about the environment, and their performance
	depends on different factors. The deployment of
	\acp{WSN} is one of these factors, and it is a combinatorial optimization
	problem where coverage, connectivity, and  energy efficiency of the network
	must be maximized.  It is a difficult problem because all these objectives are
	interrelated and some of them are in conflict, but it becomes even 
	 more difficult when adding mobility to the  network. This thesis proposes a
	 novel approach to dealing with the deployment of \acp{WSN} by adapting the
 	\ac{PSO} algorithm  as a mobility mechanism  where sensor nodes are modeled as
 	particles. The major challenges involved in this approach are adapting
 	\ac{PSO} to handle and cope with real-world characteristics, incorporating
 	individual behaviors into particles such that a global behavior emerges from
 	the local interactions, and designing different \acp{WSN} controlled by
 	\ac{PSO} for addressing different deployment scenarios.
