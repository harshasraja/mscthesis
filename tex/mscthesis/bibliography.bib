	abstract = {A fellow {DBA} recently asked me whether there's a way to delete all the records in a database without disabling the foreign keys because giving {ALTER} {TABLE} permissions to {DBO} user accounts isn't advisable. To simply display a hierarchical list of the tables with foreign keys and the tables those foreign keys are referencing, you execute the stored procedure without passing in any parameter values, as in If you want to output a list of the tables in hierarchical sequence so you can design a {SSIS} package or write an insert script that will load data into the tables, you use the {INSERT} parameter when you call the stored procedure, as in If you want to delete the data from the database tables, you use the {DELETE} parameter, as in You can download the {PR\_HJERARCHIAL\_DATA} stored procedure and {DELETE\_RECORDS} .sql script from the {SQL} Server Magazine website by going to www.sqlmag.com, entering 101931 in the {InstantDoc} {LD} text box, and clicking the 101931.zip hotlink.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} There are many examples where cooperation among scientists takes place by exchanging scientific resources, such as data, programs and mathematical models. This is particularly true for environmental applications. Finding the right resource to apply in an environmental problem is a difficult task. Usually, this decision is based on previous experience. Scientists have to cooperate in order to solve such problems. To facilitate the exchange, reuse and dissemination of information we propose an architecture for managing distributed scientific resources. Our proposal combines a mediation-based heterogeneous distributed database system and an enhanced metadata support system for effective management of distributed scientific models and data.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
